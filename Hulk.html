    <h1>The Incredible Hulk</h1>
    <p>
      At Culver University in Virginia, General Thunderbolt Ross meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and
      boyfriend of his daughter Betty, regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans
      immune to gamma radiation. The experiment—part of a World War II-era "super soldier" program that
      Ross hopes to recreate—fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into
      the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The
      Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General
      and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in
      particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years later, Banner works at a bottling factory in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, while searching for a
      cure for his condition. On the internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he
      is "Mr. Green". He is learning Yoga techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner
      cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in Milwaukee,
      Wisconsin, giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by
      Russian-born British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's
      team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar
      serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair
      his judgment.
