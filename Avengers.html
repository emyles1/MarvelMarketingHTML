<h1>Avengers</h1>
<p>
When the Asgardian god Loki seeks revenge against his brother Thor, his machinations unwittingly lead teenager
Rick Jones to collect Ant-Man, the Wasp, and Iron Man to help Thor and the Hulk, whom Loki used as a pawn.
After the group vanquished Loki, Ant-Man stated that the five worked well together and suggested they form
a team; the Wasp named the group Avengers.
</p>
<p>
The roster changed almost immediately; at the beginning of the second issue, Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at
the end of the issue, the Hulk left once he realized how much the others feared his unstable personality.
Captain America soon joined the team in issue #4, and he was given "founding member" status in the
Hulk's place. The Avengers went on to fight foes such as Baron Zemo, who formed the Masters of Evil,
Kang the Conqueror, Wonder Man, and Count Nefaria.
The next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigned; they were replaced by three former
villains: Hawkeye, the Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver. Giant-Man, now calling himself Goliath,
 and the Wasp rejoined. Hercules became part of the team, while the Black Knight, and the
Black Widow, abetted the Avengers but did not become members until years later. Spider-Man was offered
membership but did not join the group. The Black Panther joined after rescuing the team from the Grim
Reaper and Klaw.The X-Men #45 (June 1968) featured a crossover with The Avengers #53 (June 1968).
 This was followed by the introduction of the android the Vision. Pym assumed the new
identity of Yellowjacket in issue #59, and married the Wasp the following month.

<p>
The Avengers headquarters was in a New York City building called Avengers Mansion, courtesy of Tony Stark
(Iron Man's real identity). The mansion was serviced by Edwin Jarvis, the Avengers' faithful butler, and
furnished with state of the art technology and defense systems, and included the Avengers' primary mode of transport:
the five-engine Quinjet.
